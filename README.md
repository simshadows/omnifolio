# Omnifolio

My crude amateur personal finance tool that I use for my own purposes.

**IMPORTANT: No financial professionals were consulted for the development of this tool. Use it at your own risk.**

## What does it do?

For now, the scope is purely on letting me track my portfolio performance with hand-written YAML/CSV files.

Once the core is good, I'll be looking into ways to generate a graphical dashboard with it, and maybe a nice GUI where you can input your data through the GUI, but that will be for later.

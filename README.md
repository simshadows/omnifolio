I'm developing this into a portfolio aggregation tool of some sort.

For now, I'm just playing around things I'm considering using.

## Disclaimer

I am NOT an accounting or finance professional, nor have I ever received any formal training in these fields.

It must also be assumed that no part of this codebase has been reviewed by any accounting or finance professional. (Though, I do intend to have it be reviewed at some point.)

As such, I highly discourage anyone from using this tool for their own financial planning and tracking without sufficient independent research and understanding on relevant topics, and fully understanding the codebase.

By using this program, you agree that I, the developer of this codebase, and anyone else involved in developing and/or shaping this codebase cannot be held liable for any damages caused by the use of this codebase.

## Dependencies

```
pip install pandas
pip install yfinance
```

## Possible Paths Moving Forward

Option 1: A template Jupyter notebook, and my own relevant tools for financial analysis.

Option 2: A local web app.

Option 3: Both?

I'm also considering splitting the market aggregation/caching functionality into an entirely separate repository.

# Omnifolio

My crude amateur personal finance tool that I use for my own purposes.

In its current state, it's a user-unfriendly tool made only for myself. As I develop it, I hope to eventually make this useful to other people in some way.

**No financial professionals were consulted for the development of this tool. Use it at your own risk.**

## What does it do?

For now, the scope of the project is focused on letting me track my portfolio performance with hand-written YAML/CSV files.

Once the core is good, I'll be looking into ways to generate a graphical dashboard with it, and maybe a nice GUI where you can input your data through the GUI, but that will be for later.
